## History

I'm responsible for fixing bugs in the puzzle piece coding to ensure a smooth and flawless game experience. This involves analyzing instructions, identifying issues, and resolving them.

#### Game Functionality
1. **Puzzle Pieces**: 
    - Users can drag any of the four puzzle pieces into designated drop zones.
    - Each drop zone can hold only one piece at a time.
    - Once dropped, a piece stays in the zone.

2. **Background Images**:
    - Users can choose from four background images at the bottom to change the puzzle boardâ€™s background.
    - Selecting a new background returns all pieces to the puzzle area.

#### Requirements
1. **Identify Dragged Piece**: Determine which piece the user is dragging.
2. **Determine Drop Zone**: Identify the drop zone where a piece is dropped.
3. **Prevent Overlapping**: Ensure no two pieces occupy the same drop zone.
4. **Change Background**: Detect which background image is clicked and update the puzzle board accordingly.

#### Implementation
- **Background Selection**:
  - All background images are selected using `querySelectorAll` and stored in a variable.
  - Event listeners are added to each image using a `forEach` loop.
  - The `style` property of the puzzle board element is modified to change the background image.
  - The `this` keyword and image IDs are used to swap the image path correctly.

By addressing these tasks, the goal is to turn the bugs into a seamless puzzle game experience.
